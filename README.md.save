# SimpleSocketChat
This is simple TCP/UDP chat based on Berkeley sockets, QT framework and a bit of multithreading.

There are many checks in input fields, connection error handling and notifies the user about them.

There is a built-in ability to shoout your external IP address, since in modern networks the host is always using NAT.
